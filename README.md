# C-SLAKE Dataset

Here we made  the C-SLAKE publicly. 
The motivation for this dataset is to ensure the robustness of our model . We extend the publicly available Med-VQA dataset [Slake](http://www.med-vqa.com/slake.) 
to a  consistent Med-VQA dataset C-SLAKE for further consistency assessment.

The dadaset can be used for  general Med-VQA task, and also for testing model consistency.

### Folder structure

This is  the folder structure of the dataset:

**ðŸ“¦C-SLAKE**\
 â”£**ðŸ“‚[imgs](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive)**\
 â”ƒâ”—*Contains images and corresponding question and answer pairs.*\
 â”£**ðŸ“‚train**\
 â”ƒâ”—*Contains train question answer pairs.*\
 â”£**ðŸ“‚validate**\
 â”ƒâ”—*Contains validate question answer pairs.*\
 â”£**ðŸ“‚test**\
 â”ƒâ”—*Contains test question answer pairs.*

You can download the image from the above link and put it in the C-SLAKE folder.
### Question types
The questions in our dataset are selected from the Slake dataset. We conducted role-tag annotation humanly to establish connections
between interconnected question-answer pairs corresponding to the identified medical images. Diagnostic question-answer pairs are categorized into three distinct roles. The distribution of role-type questions
is presented in the following table.

**Statistics of question in different role types over training, validation, and testing sets:**

| Role-type | train | Val | Test | Total |
|-----------|-------|-----|------|-------|
| Main      | 1222  | 237 | 246  | 1705  |
| Context   | 814   | 158 | 170  | 1142  |
| Ind       | 2294  | 514 | 508  | 3316  |
| Overall   | 4330  | 909 | 924  | 6163  |

The  C-SLAKE dataset encompasses a diverse array of medical materials,including Computed
Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)scans, and X-Ray images. The distribution of it is presented in the following table:

| X-Ray         | 179  | 
| Overall       | 642  |
